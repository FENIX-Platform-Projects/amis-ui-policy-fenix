For example, if there were notifications on applied tariffs for 20 TLS that relate to wheat in 2010, then the average bound value will be calculated using those 20 TLS. If in the next year, there are were notifications on applied tariffs for 40 TLS that relate to wheat in 2011, then the average bound value will be calculated using those 40 TLS.
